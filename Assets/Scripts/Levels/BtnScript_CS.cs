    // - Create a box as large as the hole and as tall as the bots, name it PitRaycaster

    //   ground 
    // - Disable its boxcollider and the mesh renderer to make it invisible
    // - MAKE SURE TO SET ITS BOX COLLIDER AS TRIGGER
    // - Check if you have a tag "Pit", if not, create one and assign it to 
    //   the PitRaycaster
    // - Drag and drop the object into this script
    // - Check if you have a tag "Button", if not, create it and assign it
    //   to the button
